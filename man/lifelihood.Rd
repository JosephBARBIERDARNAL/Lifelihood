\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataframe with the data of life history. It should have one row per life history / observation.}

\item{path_config}{A character string specifying the file path to the YAML configuration file.}

\item{sex}{Column name containing the sex of the observations.}

\item{sex_start}{Column name containing the first date of the interval in which the sex was determined.}

\item{sex_end}{Column name containing the second date of the interval in which the sex was determined.}

\item{maturity_start}{Column name containing the first date of the interval in which the maturity was determined.}

\item{maturity_end}{Column name containing the second date of the interval in which the maturity was determined.}

\item{clutchs}{Vector containing the names of the clutch columns. The order should be: first clutch first date, first clutch second date, first clutch clutch size, second clutch first date, first clutch second date, second clutch clutch size, and so on. If the observation with the most clutches is, for example, 10, then the vector must be of size 10 x 3 = 30 (3 elements per clutch: first date, second date and size).}

\item{death_start}{Column name containing the first date of the interval in which the death was determined.}

\item{death_end}{Column name containing the second date of the interval in which the death was determined.}

\item{model_specs}{Vector of characters with the name of the statistical law to use. Must be of length 3 and each element must be in "wei", "exp", "gam" or "lgn". The first one is used for maturity, the second one is used for clutchs and the third one for death.}

\item{covariates}{Vector containing the names of the covariates.}

\item{matclutch}{Whether the maturity event (designated by \code{maturity_start} and \code{maturity_end}) is a clutch event or not. If \code{TRUE}, must specify the \code{matclutch_size} argument.}

\item{matclutch_size}{Column name containing the size of the clutch for the maturity event. Only used (and required) if \code{matclutch} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{param_bounds_df}{Dataframe with the parameter ranges/boundaries/boundaries}

\item{group_by_group}{Option to fit the full factorail model with all the interactions between each of the factors}

\item{MCMC}{Perform MCMC sampling of the parameter after convergence to estimate their 95\% confidence interval}

\item{interval}{TBD - Check the actual meaning}

\item{SEcal}{If TRUE, Lifelihood computes the standard error of each parameter using the Hessian matrix (output with value of -1 if standard error cannot be computed due to singularity of the Hessian matrix)}

\item{saveprobevent}{TBD - Check the actual meaning}

\item{fitness}{Reparametrize the model with one parameter as the lifetime reproductive success}

\item{r}{Reparametrize the model with one parameter as the intrinsic rate of increase}

\item{seeds}{Numbers used to reproduce results (same seeds = same results). This must be a vector of length 4.}

\item{ntr}{Number of thread for the paralelisation ?}

\item{nst}{TBD - Check the actual meaning}

\item{To}{Initial temperature for the simulated annealing}

\item{Tf}{Initial temperature for the simulated annealing}

\item{climbrate}{Rate for the simulated annealing ?}

\item{precision}{TBD - Check the actual meaning}

\item{raise_estimation_warning}{Whether or not to raise a warning when the estimate of a parameter is too close to its minimum or maximum bound.}

\item{right_censoring_date}{Time (integer) point at which a subjectâ€™s data is censored. This means that for subjects who do not experience the event of interest (e.g., death, failure) by this date, their data is considered censored. In practice, choose a value much larger than the maximum longevity seen in the data. (CURRENTLY IGNORED)}

\item{critical_age}{Critical age (integer) below which life histories are not followed individually. (CURRENTLY IGNORED)}

\item{ratiomax}{Maximum ratio (integer) between number of offspring of last and first reproduction events. Cannot be greater than ratiomax. (CURRENTLY IGNORED)}

\item{delete_temp_files}{Indicates whether temporary files should be deleted. TRUE by default and recommended.}

\description{
Main function of the lifelihood program. Provides the joined likelihood of all the events in an individual life-history (time of maturity, reproductive events, death).
