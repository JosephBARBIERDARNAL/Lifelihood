# Introduction
***

Since `lifelihood` allows for a large number of combinations on which parameters to estimate for a given dataset, it makes it easier to have a separate **configuration file** to specify what you want to fit. Under the hood, the program will use this file to only estimate what you have specified and returns the estimations.

The needed configuration file must be in the `yaml` format, a convenient kind of file that is both easy to **read** (for humans) and to **parse** (for the program). It relies on **indentation** to represent structure.

```yaml
constants:
  right_censoring_date: 1000
  critical_age: 20
  ratiomax: 10
