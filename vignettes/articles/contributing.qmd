# How to Contribute

Before reading this article, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the [overview of how Lifelihood works](overview.html).

## Introduction

This document outlines the guidelines and steps for contributing to the **Lifelihood** R package. Contributions from the community help improve functionality, address bugs, and ensure that **Lifelihood** remains robust and up-to-date. This guide covers setting up your development environment, working with Git, and submitting changes.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To start contributing, you’ll need to set up a local development environment where you can modify, build, and test **Lifelihood**. Follow these steps to get started:

- **Fork the Repository**

- **Clone Your Fork Locally**: run the following command in your terminal, replacing `nrode` with your GitHub username:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nrode/Lifelihood.git
cd Lifelihood
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nrode/Lifelihood
git checkout -b feature-name
```

- **Install Development Dependencies**: install all necessary dependencies for development, including **Lifelihood** itself, by running:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install()
```

## Documenting

Documentation for **Lifelihood** is managed with **Roxygen2**. If you add or modify functions, update the documentation by running:

```r
devtools::document()
```


## Testing and Validation

**Lifelihood** includes a suite of unit tests located in the `tests/` directory. These tests help ensure that changes don’t break existing functionality. Run tests using:

```r
devtools::test()
```

Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request. Adding new tests for new features or bug fixes is highly encouraged.

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Once your changes are complete and tested, submit a pull request to propose integrating them into the main **Lifelihood** repository:

Add, commit and push your branch to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m 'commit description'
git push
```

When a pull request (PR) is opened, GitHub Actions will **automatically run checks** to validate your changes. These checks include testing the codebase, ensuring consistent documentation, and verifying cross-platform compatibility. You can view the status of these checks directly in the pull request interface.
